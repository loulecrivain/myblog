Here we delve into the story of misnumbered interfaces on a GNS3 template, or how LLDP became my friend.

===

# In the beginning

the template (github link)
how did you obtain the image ? link huawei blogpost

## lab structure

## where things go wrong
how did you found the error
eth0 test
lldp debugging -> what commands did you use ?
how you found numbering was shit

# fixing it

## a small irc discussion
don't forget to credit ! -> ask on irc

1. change on GNS3 ui
2. where you found gns3 redefined interfaces template (.local)
3. hurra :) what's left: rewriting to new template

## the new template

# bonus track
link the original NE40E image on www files
for better availability
